## Programming overview
The program is mostly written in Objective-J, a language implemented by <https://www.cappuccino.dev>, and compiled by Cappuccino into JavaScript. [While the Cappuccino site looks a bit lazy, there is a small, select and active community working on it, communicating via Gitter.] Objective-J is modeled on Objective-C and implements much of Apple's GUI tools. Some parts of FrACT₁₀ are also pure JavaScript. Apple's Xcode is used as the development environment. The program is started by opening the project-relative top-level `index.html` in a browser.
